# ArtificialLifeSimulation

The Artificial Life Simulation project is a computer science project that uses the power of computers to gain understanding about the fundamental processes of living systems. 
The project involves the implementation of two primary classes - the Population class and the Organism class - to simulate the cooperation between bacteria. 
The Population class keeps track of the virtual petri dish, the environment the bacteria are living in, and collects statistical information about the experiment. 
The Organism class represents individual organisms and holds methods for determining their actions, such as cooperation, and reproduction. 
The project uses object-oriented programming to create instances of the Organism class and study the dynamics of cooperation between bacteria of the same species.
